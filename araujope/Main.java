    Description:
    This application is used for a user to store personal expenses as 
    Transaction objects, which contains fields for storing an auto assigned id,
    a date, a Category, a value, the method of payment, and an optional 
    observation. Those objects are stored in a sequential file, and each
    record can be displayed at will by selecting the filters for searching the 
    Transactions that match the search. The app also allows the user to edit and
    delete any old records.
